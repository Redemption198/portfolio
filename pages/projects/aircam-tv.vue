        AirCam TV is a separate client built with Nuxt 3, it is meant to run on large screens with no interactions in mind, such as Smart TVs or totems.

      <p class="text-center font-bold text-5xl">Dock</p>
      <p class="my-2">
        The dock offers some additional info about whatâ€™s being played on screen, like a dynamic QR Code that points to the  cam page on the main AirCam site; the cam name, weather info and the current local time.

      <p class="text-center font-bold text-5xl">Playlist</p>
      <p class="my-2">
        The AirCam TV client plays all cams in loop, a playlist manager (with external video support) was planned but never developed.
